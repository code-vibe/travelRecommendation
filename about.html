                    TravelBetter was created with a single mission: to help people discover
                    unforgettable travel experiences with ease and confidence. We believe that
                    travel should not be stressful, confusing, or overwhelming. Instead, it should
                    inspire curiosity, excitement, and a sense of adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform provides curated travel recommendations based on your interests —
                    whether you are looking for serene beaches, culturally rich temples, or vibrant
                    countries full of life. By combining technology with thoughtful travel insights,
                    we guide users toward destinations that truly match their preferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At TravelBetter, we focus on simplicity, clarity, and trust. We aim to remove
                    unnecessary complexity from travel planning and replace it with smart discovery,
                    reliable information, and visually engaging recommendations. Our goal is to
                    empower travelers to make confident decisions and explore the world better.
